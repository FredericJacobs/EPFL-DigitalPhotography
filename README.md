## Some good to know history

The camera obscura (Latin; camera for "vaulted chamber/room", obscura for "dark", together "darkened chamber/room"; plural: camera obscuras or camerae obscurae) is an optical device that projects an image of its surroundings on a screen. It is used in drawing and for entertainment, and was one of the inventions that led to photography and the camera. The device consists of a box or room with a hole in one side. Light from an external scene passes through the hole and strikes a surface inside, where it is reproduced, rotated 180 degrees (thus upside-down), but with color and perspective preserved. The image can be projected onto paper, and can then be traced to produce a highly accurate representation. Known since Aristotle (350AD), Da Vinci (1500) … 

The magic lantern or Laterna Magica is an early type of image projector developed in the 17th century.

A camera lucida is an optical device used as a drawing aid by artists.
The camera lucida performs an optical superimposition of the subject being viewed upon the surface upon which the artist is drawing. The artist sees both scene and drawing surface simultaneously, as in a photographic double exposure. This allows the artist to duplicate key points of the scene on the drawing surface, thus aiding in the accurate rendering of perspective. The camera lucida was patented in 1807 by William Hyde Wollaston.

First photograph we know of 1826, why do we claim it’s the first one? Because it’s the oldest one we have, might be other ones older that have been lost.

It’s only in the 20th century that photography became available to everyone. Color photography was invented. 

Now to the part we are concerned with: **Electronic Photography**.

In 1937, Chester Carlson came up with the Xerography. Xerography (or electrophotography) is a dry photocopying technique invented by Chester Carlson in 1938, for which he was awarded U.S. Patent 2,297,691 on October 6, 1942. Carlson originally called his invention electrophotography. It was later renamed xerography—from theGreek roots ξηρός xeros "dry" and -γραφία -graphia "writing"—to emphasize that, unlike reproduction techniques then in use such as cyanotype, this process used no liquid chemicals.

In 1969, the charge-coupled device was invented at AT&T Bell Labs by Willard Boyle and George E. Smith. A charge-coupled device (CCD) is a device for the movement of electrical charge, usually from within the device to an area where the charge can be manipulated, for example conversion into a digital value. This is achieved by "shifting" the signals between stages within the device one at a time. CCDs move charge between capacitive bins in the device, with the shift allowing for the transfer of charge between bins.

In 1975, - Steven Sasson from Kodak built the first digital camera with a Fairchild-CCD. (100x 100 pixels)
In 1981, Sony made available the first still video camera, Mavica. 
In 1988, first flatbed scanners.
In 1994, Apple made first colour digital camera under $1000.

These days cameras are everywhere and ridiculously cheap.

Cameras are now part of our social lives. Every 2 minutes, we take more pictures as the whole humanity took in the 1800s.
